# Tracer-Unit-Airsoft-v1.1
Tracer Unit based on the ATtiny84 microcontroller (due to its small size).
The tracer unit detects a BB projectile inside the unit using an IR-RX LED gate. Detection threshold is manually adjusted using an analog comparator on the PCB itself.
Upon detecting a projectile, the unit discharges an intense flash of UV light to energise the fluorescent coating on a BB projectile (which glows after leaving the barrel). 
Powered by a LiPo battery.
